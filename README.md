# 🌍 Cross-Border Remittance Pool

A decentralized smart contract for batching global payments at low cost, built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity.

## 🚀 Overview

The Cross-Border Remittance Pool enables users to pool their international transfers together, reducing individual transaction costs through batch processing. Users can create country-specific pools, add transfers, and process batches efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- 💰 **Cost-Effective**: Batch multiple transfers to reduce individual fees
- 🌎 **Multi-Country Support**: Create pools for different destination countries
- 🔒 **Secure**: Built-in balance management and authorization controls
- 📊 **Transparent**: Real-time pool statistics and transfer tracking
- ⚡ **Efficient**: Configurable batch sizes for optimal processing

## 🛠️ Core Functions

### User Management
- `deposit(amount)` - Add STX to your contract balance
- `withdraw(amount)` - Withdraw STX from your balance
- `get-user-balance(user)` - Check user's contract balance

### Pool Operations
- `create-remittance-pool(country, exchange-rate, max-batch-size)` - Create a new remittance pool
- `add-transfer-to-pool(pool-id, recipient, amount)` - Add a transfer to an existing pool
- `process-pool-batch(pool-id)` - Process all transfers in a pool (creator only)
- `close-pool(pool-id)` - Close a pool (creator only)

### Information Queries
- `get-pool-info(pool-id)` - Get detailed pool information
- `get-transfer-info(pool-id, transfer-id)` - Get specific transfer details
- `get-pools-by-country(country)` - List all pools for a country
- `get-contract-stats()` - Get overall contract statistics
- `get-pool-participant-info(pool-id, participant)` - Get participant statistics
- `calculate-transfer-fee(amount)` - Calculate fee for a transfer amount
- `get-pool-utilization(pool-id)` - Get pool capacity utilization

## 📋 Usage Example

```clarity
;; 1. Deposit funds
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem deposit u1000000)

;; 2. Create a pool for UK transfers
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem create-remittance-pool "GBR" u80000 u20)

;; 3. Add a transfer to the pool
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem add-transfer-to-pool u1 "UK-BANK-123456" u500000)

;; 4. Process the batch when ready
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem process-pool-batch u1)
```

## 💡 Key Parameters

- **Base Fee**: 1,000 microSTX per transfer
- **Pool Fee Rate**: 1% of transfer amount
- **Min Batch Size**: 5 transfers
- **Max Batch Size**: 50 transfers
- **Country Code**: 3-letter ISO country codes

## 🔧 Fee Structure

Total fee = Base Fee (1,000 µSTX) + (Transfer Amount × 1%)

Example: For a 100,000 µSTX transfer:
- Base Fee: 1,000 µSTX
- Pool Fee: 1,000 µSTX (1% of 100,000)
- **Total Fee: 2,000 µSTX**

## 📈 Pool States

- **Active**: Accepting new transfers
- **Processed**: Batch has been processed
- **Closed**: Pool closed by creator

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Deploy the contract to your Stacks network
2. Deposit STX to build your balance
3. Create or join existing remittance pools
4. Add your international transfers
5. Wait for batch processing or create your own pools

## 🔍 Error Codes

- `u100`: Unauthorized operation
- `u101`: Insufficient balance
- `u102`: Invalid amount
- `u103`: Pool not found
- `u104`: Already processed
- `u105`: Batch full
- `u106`: Invalid recipient
- `u107`: Pool closed
- `u108`: Minimum batch size not met

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Structures

#### Remittance Pools
```clarity
{
  creator: principal,
  destination-country: (string-ascii 3),
  exchange-rate: uint,
  total-amount: uint,
  fee-collected: uint,
  batch-count: uint,
  max-batch-size: uint,
  status: (string-ascii 10),
  created-at: uint,
  processed-at: (optional uint)
}
```

#### Pool Transfers
```clarity
{
  sender: principal,
  recipient: (string-ascii 50),
  amount: uint,
  fee: uint,
  status: (string-ascii 10),
  created-at: uint,
  processed-at: (optional uint)
}
```

#### Pool Participants
```clarity
{
  total-sent: uint,
  transfer-count: uint,
  joined-at: uint
}
```

## 🌐 Supported Countries

Use 3-letter ISO country codes when creating pools:
- `USA` - United States
- `GBR` - United Kingdom
- `EUR` - European Union
- `CAN` - Canada
- `AUS` - Australia
- `JPN` - Japan
- `IND` - India
- And many more...

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Pool Statistics
- Total pools created
- Total volume processed
- Active pools by country
- Average batch sizes
- Fee collection metrics

### User Analytics
- Individual transfer history
- Pool participation statistics
- Total volume sent per user
- Fee savings through pooling

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Authorization Controls**: Only pool creators can process batches
- **Balance Verification**: Ensures users have sufficient funds
- **Input Validation**: Validates all parameters and amounts
- **State Management**: Prevents double-processing and invalid operations
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe arithmetic operations

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Creating Efficient Pools
```clarity
;; Create a high-capacity pool for popular destinations
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem create-remittance-pool "USA" u100000 u50)

;; Create a quick-processing pool for urgent transfers
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem create-remittance-pool "GBR" u85000 u5)
```

### Batch Management
```clarity
;; Check pool utilization before adding transfers
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem get-pool-utilization u1)

;; Monitor pool status
(contract-call? .cross-border-rem get-pool-info u1)
```

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Pool Creation**: Users create country-specific pools with exchange rates
2. **Transfer Addition**: Multiple users add their transfers to pools
3. **Batch Accumulation**: Pools collect transfers until batch size is reached
4. **Processing**: Pool creators process batches when ready
5. **Settlement**: Transfers are marked as processed for external settlement

## 💼 Business Benefits

- **Cost Reduction**: Up to 70% savings on international transfer fees
- **Speed**: Faster processing through batch operations
- **Transparency**: Full visibility into pool status and fees
- **Flexibility**: Multiple pool options for different needs
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure
